## RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN
Responsive web design is an approach to building websites that ensures that they look and function well on all types of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.

The basic idea behind responsive design is to use flexible layouts and elements that can adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. This way, the content on the website will always be easy to read and navigate, no matter what device a user is using.<br>
<h2>HAMBURGER ICON</h2>
Hamburger icon is a commonly used icon in responsive web design for menus that are hidden on smaller screens and revealed through a toggle button or icon. The hamburger icon consists of three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, resembling the appearance of a hamburger.

In CSS, the hamburger icon can be created using a combination of ::before and ::after pseudo-elements and the transform property to create the three lines.
